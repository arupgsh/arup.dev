I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in Oslo. I work at the intersection of toxicology and genomics, developing new approach methodologies (NAMs) to predict adverse outcomes.

I am interested in applying machine learning to genomics and biomedical data science to extract insights from large-scale datasets.

Outside of research, I am part of the eLife Community Ambassadors and the ASAPbio Ambassador programme, promoting open science, preprints, and research reproducibility while contributing to the computational biology community.
